# RL_2024_Sapienza

## Project Description
The project has been developed in order to test a method to perform sim2real for a differential drive robot.
The Paper that has been used as reference is [Deep Reinforcement Learning With Action Masking for Differential-Drive Robot Navigation Using Low-Cost Sensors] (pdf in the repo).

## Advice
In order to understand all the steps of the project, it is recommended to take a look to the PDF presentation in the repo.

It contains a description of the problem, the stack used, the architecture of the different pieces of the project and the results obtained.
